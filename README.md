This website uses the twitterExchange API to fetch content(tweets) and display them. This website allows users to register, log in, search content on twitter, generate wordclouds from these searches, and share them with other users. 

The most popular wordclouds are displayed when a user logs in. A user can then search, generate, and share his own wordclouds.
